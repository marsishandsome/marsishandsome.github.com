### CAP定理 (Eric Brewer)
- [Wikipedia](CAP theorem)

In theoretical computer science, the CAP theorem, also known as Brewer's theorem, states that it is impossible for a distributed computer system to simultaneously provide all three of the following guarantees:
1. Consistency (all nodes see the same data at the same time)
2. Availability (a guarantee that every request receives a response about whether it succeeded or failed)
3. Partition tolerance (the system continues to operate despite arbitrary message loss or failure of part of the system)
